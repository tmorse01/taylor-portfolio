# Copilot Prompt

**Goal:** Enhance my existing Tailwind gradient `Button` component with subtle **hover flash** effects.

**Requirements:**

- Keep the existing Tailwind gradient background.
- Add **hover scale** (`hover:scale-105`) for a gentle grow effect.
- Add a **glow ring on hover** using `hover:shadow-[0_0_20px_rgba(56,224,231,0.6)]` (teal accent color).
- Ensure transitions are smooth with `transition-all` and `duration-300`.

**Constraints:**
✅ Maintain Tailwind for styling.  
✅ Keep the button accessible and responsive.  
✅ Keep it lightweight without adding libraries.

**Deliverable:**
Updated `Button` component JSX with these effects applied, ready to replace my current gradient buttons.
